# Project: [BEMIFY.ME](https://beamify.me)  
Our project has a very interesting concept, where we create the platform that anyone can setup and deploy and use as their own. 
It just doesn't stop there though, we want this platform to have everything. Hook it up to [Plesk]() and you have a fully functional WPP (Web Payment Platform),
 attach to [Digital Ocean]() and you have a fully functional cloud platform. Even media streaming, we have that covered. Vertical, horizontal, up, down, left and right, 
even scaling is simplified and made easier. [Docker]() & [Portainer]() support, both locally and on the cloud. We have it all.

We are even building a fully functional content distribution network, with a twist. We are using [IPFS](), [Peer2Peer](), [Webtorrent]() and more, 
to deliver a fully functional CDN that is decentralized and distributed.

Our aim, is to cut costs on many factors, to make it easier for users to deploy and manage their own platforms, with functioning ways to develop and deploy their own applications.

### MVP Release
We are currently working on providing a fully working backend and frontend solution for the MVP release.

There are a lot of **'Core Features'** that we are building.

- [x] Full User Management  
Login, Register, Forgot Password, Reset Password, Update Profile, Delete Account
- [x] User Blogging  
With everything you would expect from a blogging platform
- [x] Ecommerce with Vendor Management  
A fully functional ecommerce platform, fully stocked with products and the ability for users to create their own ecommerce.
- [x] Social Media  
A fully functional social media platform, with all the features you would expect from a social media platform.
- [x] Live Streaming  
Everything you would ever need from a live streaming platform, including push notifications, live chat, and more.

Once we have a fully working MVP, we will then release our 'Docker' deployments for 'Edging' to our 'Content Delivery Network', this will allow users to deploy their own instances of BEME.
This includes an 'Edge' version of our 'Streaming Engine'. This will be an ideal solution, for those who want more control over their content or developers who want to build their own 
solutions on top of BEME, through the development platform.
