### MVP Release
We are currently working on providing a fully working backend and frontend solution for the MVP release.

There are a lot of **'Core Features'** that we are building.

- [x] Full User Management  
Login, Register, Forgot Password, Reset Password, Update Profile, Delete Account
- [x] User Blogging  
With everything you would expect from a blogging platform
- [x] Ecommerce with Vendor Management  
A fully functional ecommerce platform, fully stocked with products and the ability for users to create their own ecommerce.
- [x] Social Media  
A fully functional social media platform, with all the features you would expect from a social media platform.
- [x] Live Streaming  
Everything you would ever need from a live streaming platform, including push notifications, live chat, and more.

Once we have a fully working MVP, we will then release our 'Docker' deployments for 'Edging' to our 'Content Delivery Network', this will allow users to deploy their own instances of BEME.
This includes an 'Edge' version of our 'Streaming Engine'. This will be an ideal solution, for those who want more control over their content or developers who want to build their own 
solutions on top of BEME, through the development platform.
